 A braggot does not have to be sweet, nor smell of honey.
 The goal of a braggot is to balance the flavors, aromas, and bitterness of the beer with the same from honey to make a
 delicious bevarage. Spices, fruit, oak, and other ingredients are common but not necessary.

 Balance is a difficult item to find, not to mention create. The grand goal is to balance without notice. That is,
 make something interesting or unique that is balanced without being obtuse. Blending an earthy hop with alfalfa blossom
 honey to make an old farmer glad. Or blending orange blossom honey with an IPA to snare a hop-head.

 Braggots can combine any beer with any mead to make the desired goal. Using spices
 and fruits with smoked malts and oak is totally acceptable. The goals is to show a balance between all
 the ingredients.
