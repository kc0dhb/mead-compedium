\section{Introduction}
 This is meant to consolidate knowledge of a more advanced nature. Thus this is more for those already somewhat 
 versed in fermentation and mead. There will be some information that seems elementary, and some that is obtuse.
 
 One of the best things you can do to make great mead is to use the best ingredients -- the best honey, the best 
 fruits, and the best spices. Skimping on one or more of your ingredients often results in meads less than the 
 best you can do. Even the best process can't elevate poor ingredients to greatness, however we wish it might.

 This is a work in progress and will likely never be completely finished. There may even be information in
 here that isn't entirely correct. As such references will be used whenever found and updates done with more 
 information. Disputed sections will be marked and updated with knowledge as acquired.

% TODO add a good/best/better view here.
