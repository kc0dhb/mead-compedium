\section{Oak}
  Oak is  a complex and enjoyable addition to mead. It can add complexity as well as structure. However it can easily
  be overdone. Aging with oak is a bit of an art and is about balancing the flavors of oak and mead. It is also
  possible to drastically change the flavor of a mead simply by aging it in a barrel that was previously used
  for spirits or another type of beverage. Rum, Bourbon, and Whisk(e)y are quite common and can easily overwhelm
  your mead if not careful.

 \subsection{Types of Oak}
  There are quite a few different types of oak, each giving its own characteristic flavor and aroma.
  In general the denser the oak variety the longer it takes to impart its characteristics. 

 \subsection{Barrels}
  Barrels are the traditional way of aging with oak.

 \subsection{When to Use Oak}

 \subsection{Aging with Oak}
  Aging with oak is rather straightforward after deciding that your mead needs some oak. Your goal is to get the
  appropriate balance and blending of oak and mead. For some styles, such as traditional, the oak should be supporting
  and not overpowering. If the flavor is particularly strong or dominant than it isn't a traditional mead anymore.
  Some styles, such as high alcohol sweet meads can take a significantly larger amount of oak compared to low alcohol
  dry meads. So the amount of oak aging can change drastically based on the type of mead you are doing. 
  
  Another thing to take into consideration is that not everyone appreciates oak in the same amount. It may be worth
  doing a taste testing with others to get a feel for where you land on oak preferences. And as taste changes
  over time, it is probably worth doing more than once.
  
  Be sure to taste every so often. Once the amount of oak you want is acheived you may think it is time to rack
  and bottle and you've captured that flavor. However that is not entirely the case. 
  First, Over time you will notice that the oak characteristics will fade. Second, you may notice that
  significant sediment can drop out in the bottle. This is often more true with barrel aging. Dealing with the first
  is a bit of an art, the second is just patience.
  
  To combat the oak flavor fading you can simply aim for a slightly over oaked flavor when racking off of oak. It
  isn't a large amount of time that this takes, often it is only 1-10\% more time. Then rack it away from the oak. 
  This is of course not very precise. Another method is to go to your threshold for oaking, then rack at this point.
  Over time the flavor will change and soften.
